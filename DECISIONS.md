# GLM5X Engineering Decisions

## D-0001 — Pivot from Kimi K3 to GLM-5.x

- Decision: build GLM5X as a new repository and use GLM-5.2 as the first executable target.
- Alternatives: continue K3X, or fork K3X in place.
- Evidence: GLM-5.x has a smaller active expert set and a built-in MTP path that matches the existing expert-cache and speculative roadmap better.
- Accepted because: a clean repository prevents Kimi-specific graph and weight assumptions from leaking into the GLM runtime.
- Revisit: when GLM-5.3 configuration and weights are public.

## D-0002 — Preserve the K3X storage core

- Decision: retain the aligned extent, checksum, resume, cache, prefetch, and benchmark interfaces as an internal compatibility core.
- Alternatives: rewrite storage immediately, or use a general safetensors/GGUF runtime.
- Evidence: these boundaries are independent of Kimi tensor names and already have focused tests.
- Accepted because: it shortens the path to a bounded GLM artifact while keeping storage streaming and correctness gates.
- Revisit: after the first GLM-5.2 end-to-end trace.

## D-0003 — Delete official K3 artifacts, preserve synthetic fixtures

- Decision: delete only verified official K3 source/derived artifact directories and retain synthetic fixtures used by the old repository's tests.
- Alternatives: delete the entire old K3X repository or delete every `.safetensors` file.
- Evidence: the pre-delete inventory identified official artifacts separately from `synthetic-k3-source-v1` fixtures.
- Accepted because: it removes Kimi weight storage without destroying reusable correctness fixtures or historical code.
- Revisit: never unless the user explicitly requests full old-repository archival deletion.
